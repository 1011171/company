Disney PhotoPass Downloads
The Disney Platinum Plus Pass, Disney Platinum Pass and Disney Gold Pass include a benefit that lets you access and download Disney PhotoPass photos captured in your account from the first valid date of your pass until your pass expires. Plus, access and downloading is available after pass expiration for as long as the photo is stored in the system (365 days from date of capture).To start using this benefit, simply link your pass to the Disney account you will use to retrieve photos.

Access and downloading is not available for photos captured after pass expiration or after a pass is removed from a Disney account.
